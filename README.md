# Friend-book-Friend-suggestion
Friend Book is an intelligent social networking platform that recommends new friends based on semantic similarity. Instead of relying solely on mutual friends or location, Friend Book uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to analyze user bios, interests, and posts to suggest meaningful connections.
